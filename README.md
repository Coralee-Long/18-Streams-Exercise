Step 2: Use 'map' and double each number in the list.

Step 3: Sort the list in ascending order.

Step 4: Perform a 'reduce' operation to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.

Step 5: Use 'forEach' and output each processed number.

Step 6: Collect the processed numbers into a new list using 'collect'.
